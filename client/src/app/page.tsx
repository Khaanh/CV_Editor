							<h1>Dear Andreas Emer</h1>
							<br />
							<article>
								Last year, I had the pleasure of attending a conference at your
								office dedicated to website performance and tools such as Google
								Page Speed by Niklas Wolf. I was deeply impressed not only by
								the atmosphere in your office but also by your approach to
								development and the professionalism of your team. Your company
								has left a lasting impression on me to this day. By sheer
								chance, I stumbled upon a vacancy on the germantechjobs.de
								website. I never thought such an opportunity would come by so
								rarely, and I would like to briefly introduce myself and explain
								how I can be of value to your team. My name is Khanh. Two years
								ago, I relocated to Germany from Ukraine and have since been
								actively seeking opportunities to contribute to a company I will
								collaborate. In Ukraine, I specialized in developing various
								types of websites, ranging from landing pages to E-commerce
								platforms, with a strong focus on mobile responsiveness, loading
								speed optimization, GPS integration, and enhancing user
								experience. My skill set encompasses proficiency in HTML & CSS
								(including SASS), jQuery, JavaScript, CSS animations, Bootstrap,
								and GULP. Furthermore, I have recently expanded my expertise to
								include emerging technologies such as React, TypeScript,
								Next.js, and Node.js (Express), as evidenced by the five
								completed projects showcased in my portfolio. I am a determined
								and dedicated professional, driven by the desire to make a
								meaningful contribution to a company. While my current
								experience and skills may appear insufficient for your position,
								my eagerness to learn, diligence, and genuine interest in new
								technologies will enable me to quickly adapt and become a
								valuable asset to your team.
								<br />
								<p>
									Please feel free to email me via email at
									Khanh13nguyen13@gmal.com with any further questions.
								</p>
								<p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
								<p>Warm regards,</p>
